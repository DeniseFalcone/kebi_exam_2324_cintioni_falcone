# **Personalized Menu Recommendations in Restaurants Using Knowledge Graphs, Ontologies, and Agile BPMN Processes**

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a sophisticated Knowledge Base
aimed at generating personalized menus tailored to customers’ specific dietary needs
and preferences. This initiative brings together a variety of advanced tools and tech-
nologies to effectively address the complexity of the task.
To achieve this goal, various tools and technologies were used: Camunda (Chapter 2)
has been utilized for modeling and managing decision-making processes, while Prolog
(Chapter 3) underpins the implementation of Rule-Based Systems. Proteg´e (Chapter 4)
has played a key role in Ontology Engineering, ensuring a robust and flexible conceptual
framework for the Knowledge Base. Additionally, AOAME and Jena Fuseki 5) provide
crucial support for graphical data representation and efficient query execution.
